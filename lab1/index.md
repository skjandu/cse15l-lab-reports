# Hello, world! (automatic horizontal line inserted below) 
## Hello, world! But smaller (automatic horizontal line inserted below) 
Here we have a word that is *italicized* and here we have another in **bold**. 

Here is a [link](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week1/#lab-tasks) to the week 1 lab tasks.

A list of groceries:
- Apples
- Bananas
- Butter

We can also do a numbered list:
1. Apples
2. Bananas
3. Butter

I can have a horizontal line right below this title.

I can also have a regular body of text and a thicker horizontal line by inserting an extra empty line after typing this text.

Now we can incorporate a block of code:
```
print('Hello world') 
```
